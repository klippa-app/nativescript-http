/**
 * Add a new certificate to pin.
 *
 * Warning: Certificate Pinning is Dangerous!
 * Pinning certificates limits your server team’s abilities to update their TLS certificates.
 * By pinning certificates, you take on additional operational complexity and limit your ability to migrate between certificate authorities.
 * Do not use certificate pinning without the blessing of your server’s TLS administrator!
 *
 * Note about self-signed certificates:
 * Can not be used to pin self-signed certificate if such certificate is not accepted by javax.net.ssl.TrustManager.
 *
 * @param pattern Pinning is per-hostname and/or per-wildcard pattern. To pin both publicobject.com and www.publicobject.com you must configure both hostnames. Or you may use patterns to match sets of related domain names. The following forms are permitted:
 *                Full domain name: you may pin an exact domain name like www.publicobject.com. It won’t match additional prefixes (us-west.www.publicobject.com) or suffixes (publicobject.com).
 *                Any number of subdomains: Use two asterisks to like **.publicobject.com to match any number of prefixes (us-west.www.publicobject.com, www.publicobject.com) including no prefix at all (publicobject.com). For most applications this is the best way to configure certificate pinning.
 *                Exactly one subdomain: Use a single asterisk like *.publicobject.com to match exactly one prefix (www.publicobject.com, api.publicobject.com). Be careful with this approach as no pinning will be enforced if additional prefixes are present, or if no prefixes are present.
 *                Note that any other form is unsupported. You may not use asterisks in any position other than the leftmost label.
 *                If multiple patterns match a hostname, any match is sufficient. For example, suppose pin A applies to *.publicobject.com and pin B applies to api.publicobject.com. Handshakes for api.publicobject.com are valid if either A’s or B’s certificate is in the chain.
 *                Note: for iOS, *.publicobject.com also behaves as **.publicobject.com due to limitation in TrustKit.
 *                Note 2: for Android, if you use the older version of OkHttp, the **. prefix does not work.
 *                Note 3: for iOS, you need to have at least 2 hashes, because Trustkit requires you to have a backup certificate.
 * @param hashes SHA-256 hashes. Each pin is a hash of a certificate's Subject Public Key Info, base64-encoded. Don't prefix with `sha256/`.
